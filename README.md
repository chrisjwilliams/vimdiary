# vimdiary
A simple file based diary/notebook system using vim as a text editor
A new file is created for each day, and for each notebook.
Suited for those who prefer life on the command line rather than a Gui.

## Requirements
You will need to have bash and vim installed.

## Getting Started
Put vimdiary in your PATH, and then run it from the terminal to get started with your diary.
```bash
vimdiary
```

You can have multiple notebooks, not just a diary. Just specify a name for your notebook
```bash
vimdiary lab_book
```
For more options and configurations run 
```bash
vimdiary --help
```
